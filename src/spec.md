# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a clear donation line with the Cash App handle “$WOTWM” to the global site footer.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx` to render a new donation line beneath the existing YouTube subscription line with wording like “Donate: Cash App $WOTWM”.
- Ensure the footer text remains centered and readable across mobile and desktop without spacing/overflow issues.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a donation prompt in the footer on all pages/sections where the footer appears, including the exact Cash App handle “$WOTWM”.

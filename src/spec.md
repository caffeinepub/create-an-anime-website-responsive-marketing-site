# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the “Clan Eyes” worldbuilding rules to clarify controllable activation and awareness, with a specific caveat for the trio.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `frontend/src/content/animeSiteConfig.ts` so `worldbuilding.clanEyeRules` contains 6 rules total.
- Revise the 5th rule to state that activation is controllable, but not for the trio yet.
- Add a 6th rule stating that characters who have control are completely aware of activation, but the trio is not yet.

**User-visible outcome:** The Worldbuilding → “Clan Eyes” bullet list displays six rules in order, including the updated controllable activation rule and the new awareness rule with the trio exception.

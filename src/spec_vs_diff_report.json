  "summary": "Donation section (`frontend/src/components/RewardsSection.tsx`) was substantially rewritten to include a “Support Whispers Of The White Moon” intro with emojis, a Cash App block showing “Donate Via Cash App”, “Send support to:”, and “$WOTWM”, and a “Rewards” heading followed by a tier list rendered from `animeSiteConfig.rewards.tiers`. However, the section still renders a `SectionHeader` titled “Donation”, which may conflict with the requirement to replace *all* existing content with the provided copy.",

      "reason": "The updated section still includes a `SectionHeader` with title \"Donation\", which appears to be leftover/extra content rather than the specified “Support Whispers Of The White Moon” donation copy. This may prevent the Donation section from matching the provided copy exactly and violates “replace all existing content”.",

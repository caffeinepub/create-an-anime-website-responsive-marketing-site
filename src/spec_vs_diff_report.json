  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented by building a metadataParts array and only pushing the age segment when character.age is present, which also avoids extra separators by joining with a single delimiter. REQ-1 cannot be confirmed from the provided truncated diff for animeSiteConfig.ts (the Kuroshi Shirogane entry is not shown), so it may still be missing or just not visible in the excerpt.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the character data in `frontend/src/content/animeSiteConfig.ts` so that Kuroshi Shirogane (Sensei) does not have an age value (remove the `age: 13` entry entirely or set it to a missing/undefined value that will not render). Do not replace it with another age or with the word \"Unknown\".",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt for `animeSiteConfig.ts` is truncated and does not include the Kuroshi Shirogane (Sensei) character object, so there is no direct evidence in the provided diff summary that `age: 13` was removed/omitted for that character.",
